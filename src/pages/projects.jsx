							Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of impactful projects, particularly in large-scale government initiatives. Many of the projects I contributed to were in-house, focused on areas like water canals and irrigation systems, and were primarily tailored for governmental use, so they remain unpublished. However, there are a few projects I’ve been part of that are publicly accessible. These projects reflect my evolution as a programmer and are an ongoing source of learning. I invite you to explore the code, share insights, and collaborate for further improvements. It’s always inspiring to exchange ideas and grow through collaboration.
